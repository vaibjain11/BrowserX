=# BrowserX

**BrowserX** is a **multithreaded browser simulator** developed in **C/C++** using the **GTK GUI toolkit**. This project demonstrates advanced programming concepts including file I/O, inter-process communication via pipes, and graphical user interface development.

## Key Features:

- **Concurrent Rendering**: Capable of simultaneously rendering **1000 user-provided URLs** in separate windows, showcasing efficient **multithreading** implementation.

- **URL Validation**: Implements robust **URL validation** to ensure only valid web addresses are processed.

- **Favorites Management**: Allows users to save and organize their **favorite websites** for quick access.

- **Site Blacklisting**: Provides functionality to block unwanted websites, enhancing user control over browsing experience.

- **Search History**: Maintains a log of visited URLs, enabling users to easily revisit previously accessed web pages.

## Technical Highlights:

- Developed using **C/C++** for core functionality and performance optimization.

- Utilizes the **GTK toolkit** for creating a responsive and user-friendly graphical interface.

- Implements **file I/O** operations for managing favorites and browsing history.

- Leverages **pipes** for efficient inter-process communication in the multithreaded environment.

This project demonstrates proficiency in **systems programming**, **GUI development**, and implementing practical features to enhance user experience in a browser-like application.
